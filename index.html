                module &
                finish the assignments properly & submit it in time.</p>

            <p>I am a lazy person surely. But I understand my works properly. But laziness push us back in every work.
                But now, for Jhankar Mahbub vaiya's pressure, I am back on my flow. I try to finish my work in time.
                In sha Allah, if I cam back on my track, I will succeed in future.</p>

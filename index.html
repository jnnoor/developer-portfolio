            <p>I am a lazy person surely. But I understand my works properly. But laziness push us back in every work.
                But now, for Jhankar Mahbub vaiya's pressure, I am back on my flow. I try to finish my work in time. I
                tried to write the true things. So I am seeking for forgiveness is I made any fun with you. But I am
                serious.</p>
